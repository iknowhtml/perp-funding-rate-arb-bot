# Coinbase MCP Server Usage

**ALWAYS use the Coinbase CDP MCP server when working with anything Coinbase-related.**

## When to Use

Use the Coinbase MCP server for:
- Questions about Coinbase Advanced Trade API
- Coinbase API authentication (ES256 JWT, CDP API keys)
- Coinbase SDK usage (`@coinbase-sample/advanced-trade-sdk-ts`)
- Coinbase adapter implementation or debugging
- Coinbase API endpoints, rate limits, or best practices
- Any Coinbase-related code generation or documentation lookup

## How to Use

The Coinbase MCP server is configured at `.cursor/mcp.json` with the URL:
```
https://docs.cdp.coinbase.com/mcp
```

**Before answering Coinbase-related questions or implementing Coinbase features:**

1. **Search CDP documentation** using the MCP server
2. **Reference official Coinbase patterns** from the documentation
3. **Use accurate API endpoints** and authentication methods from the docs
4. **Follow Coinbase best practices** as documented in CDP

## Example Usage

Instead of guessing or using generic patterns:

```typescript
// ❌ Bad: Generic implementation without checking docs
const signRequest = (method: string, path: string) => {
  // Guessing at Coinbase auth...
};

// ✅ Good: Use MCP to search CDP docs first
// "Search Coinbase CDP docs for Advanced Trade API authentication"
// Then implement based on official documentation
```

## MCP Server Capabilities

The Coinbase MCP server provides:
- **Documentation search**: Search all CDP documentation
- **API reference**: Access to latest API endpoints and schemas
- **Best practices**: Official patterns and recommendations
- **Code examples**: Real examples from Coinbase documentation

## Testing MCP Connection

To verify the MCP server is working, ask:
- "What MCP tools do you have available?"
- "Search Coinbase CDP docs for Advanced Trade API authentication"
