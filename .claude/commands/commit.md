Generate a commit message and create a commit by following the process defined in `.cursor/skills/write-commit-message-and-commit/SKILL.md`.

Read that file first, then execute the commit workflow it defines: gather context from staged changes, classify the change type, write a conventional commit message, and create the commit.

If the changes are plan implementations, review the relevant plan file alongside the code changes to write an accurate commit message.
